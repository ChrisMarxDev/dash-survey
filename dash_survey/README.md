- ðŸ“± Material Design UI components

## Getting Started

Add `dash_survey` to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  dash_survey: ^1.0.0
```

Then, import the package in your Dart file and wrap your app in a `DashSurvey` and supply the api key you got from the dashboard at https://app.dash-survey.com

```dart
import 'package:dash_survey/dash_survey.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(DashSurvey(
    apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
    app: MyApp(),
  ));
}
```

<!-- ## Demo Modus

To check the look and feel of DashSurvey, you can use the demo modus.
For that, just pass `demoMode: true` to the `DashSurvey` constructor. -->

## Basic Usage

There are two ways to show a survey:

1. As native element of your app. This way you can show surveys in any widget of your app.
2. As modal on top of your app. This way you can show surveys as a modal on top of your app.

### 1. Native Survey Element

When using the `DashSurveyBuilder` widget, it will automatically fetch and display surveys that are due to be shown.
If no surveys are available, it will render as SizedBox.shrink().

```dart
import 'package:dash_survey/dash_survey.dart';

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        // Card(),
        // Text(),
        // ...
        DashSurveyBuilder(),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

The `DashSurveyBuilder` can be fully customized, to match your app's design.
Checkout the [Example app](https://github.com/ChrisMarxDev/dash-survey/tree/main/dash_survey/example) for more examples.

```dart
DashSurveyBuilder(
  surveyFrameBuilder: (context, child, surveyState) {
    return Card(
      child: child,
    );
  },
);
```

### 2. Survey as Modal

To display a survey as a modal on top of your app, you can use the `DashSurvey.showModal` method.
This will check if there are any surveys that are due to be shown and display the first one.
If no surveys are due to be shown, it will not display anything.

```dart
import 'package:dash_survey/dash_survey.dart';

void main() {
  // Show the survey as a modal
  DashSurvey.show(
    context,
    onSubmit: (survey) {
      // Handle survey results
    },
    onCancel: (survey) {
      // Handle survey cancellation
    },
  );
}
```
